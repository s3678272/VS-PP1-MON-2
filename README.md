BUILD INSTALLATION AND RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS

- Click the GitHub link above to extract all the files for the project in three Sprints

- Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 are presented as a zipped package with relevant query forms 
  and screenshots of pages created with WordPress

- Use the WordPress login information to click the WordPress link to log in, 
  and select the 'page' button in the left navigation bar to see the relevant query page. 
  After clicking on the specific query page, the 'view' in the upper right corner can 
  choose to browse on different devices, such as: PC, Pad, or Mobile phone

- Sprint 3 contains some modified query form (in PDF form) using Adobe Acrobat DC, 
  and a query page developed using front-end code. If you want to experience these 
  PDF files better, you need to download Adobe Acrobat DC from the Microsoft Store 
  or Adobe official. After downloading, change the opening method of the PDF file 
  to Adobe Acrobat DC. For HTML+CSS source files, you can use a local notepad to 
  open them. For a better experience, you can also download Visual Studio Code, 
  which can be edited without any plug-ins. Click the suffix .html to run the 
  corresponding front-end page directly in the browser
  
- After completing the above series of work, deploy the query form to the company 
  website. Click the company link of the above client, click 'services' in the top 
  navigation bar, and then select the required service to see the corresponding 
  query form.
  
- Trello records the goals, tasks, and staff assignments for all Sprints of the project. 
  Freedcamp records related tasks assigned by clients to team members.
